- 👋 Hi, I’m @khryo-makhina
- 👀 I’m am into micro services with .NET Core, Uncle Bob's clean code, Vue.JS and small offline LLM model RAG. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning for a specific purpose, and not so for LLM models because the responses should be accurate and precise.
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborate on a transliteration service that writes as pronounced without or with the Vietnamese diacritics.
- 📫 You can reach me out via Github.
