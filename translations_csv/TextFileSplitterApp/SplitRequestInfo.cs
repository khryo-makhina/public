This property is used to determine how many lines are present in the original file, which is crucial for calculating how many output files will be created based on the specified number of lines to split per file. It is typically initialized during the split request setup by reading the input file and counting its lines.

This property is calculated based on the total number of lines in the input file and the number of lines to split per file. It provides an estimate of how many files will be generated, which can be useful for logging, user feedback, or pre-allocating resources for handling the output files.

This property is used to capture and store any issues that arise while setting up the split request, such as invalid file paths, unreadable files, or other exceptions. It allows for error handling and reporting, enabling the application to provide feedback to the user or log errors for troubleshooting purposes.
